This is the first proper project from TOP. This is to check all of the Command Line, Git, and HTML knowledge I have. It's gonna look rough, but that's how we like it.

My HTML knowledge is still relatively good. A few snafoos with relative links in the process.

Getting more of a hang of command line and uploading stuff to git.

Still working on commits, but I realise that with HTML pages it's much less of an issue, just habit building.
